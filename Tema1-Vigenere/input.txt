How to Reprogram Your Brain to Enjoy Hard Habits
You can make hard habits more attractive if you learn to associate them with a positive experience.
Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to
do in a given day.
Now imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for
work. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing
these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.
The key point is that both the versions of reality are true. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we
choose.
I asked a man using a wheelchair whether it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined
to my wheelchair-I’m liberated by it.
Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way
to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.
Exercise. Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you
down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling
yourself “I need to go run in the morning,” say “It’s time to build endurance and get fast.”
Finance. Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, you can associate it with freedom
rather than limitation if you realize one simple truth: living below your current means increases your
future means. The money you save this month increases your purchasing power next month.
Meditation. Anyone who has tried meditation for more than 3 seconds knows how frustrating it can be
when the next distraction inevitably pops up in your mind. You can transform frustration into delight
when you realize that each interruption gives you a chance to practice returning to your breath.
Pregame jitters. Many people feel anxious before delivering a big presentation or competing in an
important event. They experience faster breathing, faster heart rate. If we interpret these things negatively,
then we feel threatened and tense up. If we interpret these feelings positively, then we can respond with
fluidity and grace. You can reframe “I’m nervous” to “I’m excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to
help me concentrate.
If you want to take it a step further, you can create a motivation ritual. You simply practice associating
your habits with something you enjoy, then you use that cue whenever you need a bit of motivation.
A boxer and writer says, “My focus and concentration goes up by just putting my headphones on while
writing. I don’t even have to play music.
Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to perform. It not only physically warms
me up, but more importantly, it puts me in the right mental state feeling competitive and focused.
You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find
something that makes you truly happy-and then create a short routine that you perform every time you do
the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and smile. Repeat.
Eventually, you will begin to associate this breath-and smile routine with being in a good mood. It
becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to
change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take 3 breaths and smile. Sad about life? Take 3 breaths
and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if has little to do with the
original situation.
